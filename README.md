# Predicting-Fraud-Using-Machine-Learning

A machin learning model was developed to predict fraud. I used the credit card dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The main problem found with this dataset is it's highly imbalanced, only 5% of the transactions were fradulent. 

To counter this problem I used three different imbalanced techniques to demonstrate the impact it has on the machine learning algorithms performance. The three machine learning algorithms I used were Linear Discriminante Analysis, Gradient Boosting Machine and Classification and Regression Tree. 

A confusion matrix was used to evanluate the performance of all three algorithms.
